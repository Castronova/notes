## 1. The Language of the Research Bid

**Defining Research**  
    * Are you proposing _research_ or _development_?  
    * Research - Systematic investigation and study of materials, etc.  
    * Development - To bring or come to an active, visible, or mature state. [NSF WILL NOT FUND THIS!!]  
    * Am I proposing an activity that will lead to new knowledge or something that makes use of existing knowledge to improve something?  

**Who is the customer?**  
    * person or agency  
    * must be convinced that you have a good idea that the you can perform the promised research  
    * `COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING`  
        1. email explaining: who you are, your idea, your solution, ask for there feedback.  Is this something that they are interested in, would it fit their program?  Remember these are faculty on leave from university...they understand your situation!  
        2.  `DON'T EVER SEND A PROPOSAL IN WITHOUT TALKING WITH THE PROGRAM MANAGER`  
        3.  1-3 page white paper can be helpful, but not until you contact the program manager!!!!   
        4. Every good research idea has multiple target grants and programs!  
        5. You are trying to get a feel for if your idea will have a high success probability
    * Program managers must justify your grant to their supervisor.  They want to look good too.  

**Grant Proposal Guide**  
    * Need to be familiar with this NSF document  
    * Primary guidebook for all NSF proposals  

**Peer Review**  
    * Your grant will be peer-reviewed.  
    * You likely know some of these people  
    * Never be negative about someones research in your proposal!  
    *

**Pre Proposal**  
    * Very succinct, make sure this is brief  
    * 2-10 pages  
    * Don't worry about details  
    * Not a technical paper, it is designed to sell your research  
    * What do you expect to get out of your results?  
        1. Draft an outline, make multiple drafts  
        2. Tell the what are you going to do, tell them how you did (or will do) it, tell them what you did  


**Risk / Reward**  
    * Always consider the potential success rate of your proposal  
    * Does you risk/reward ratio justify submitting the proposal?  
    * What is unique about your proposed work?   
    
    
**Some Industry Terms**  
    * Ghosts: this could be equipment that you have which the other bidders do not  
    * Oh-oh : Address your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them.  Do not try to hide them  
    * Silver-bullet : A decisive strategy that can be used to eliminate the competition   
    * Theme: selling message that is woven into the proposal.  Must make it clear to the reader what it is that you are selling.  
 **AVOID**  
    * Me-too: demonstrating that you are "as-good" as the competition.  You need to stand out  


**BROADER IMPACTS**  
* They love seeing unique broader impacts  
    * e.g. Demonstrating your research to the public  
* They expect (and see a lot of) graduate students related, generic outreach, etc.    

## 2. Bidding Costs and Help from your University
