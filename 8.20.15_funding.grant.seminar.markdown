## 1. The Language of the Research Bid

* Defining Research
    * Are you proposing _research_ or _development_?  
    * Research - Systematic investigation and study of materials, etc.  
    * Development - To bring or come to an active, visible, or mature state. [NSF WILL NOT FUND THIS!!]  
    * Am I proposing an activity that will lead to new knowledge or something that makes use of existing knowledge to improve something?  

* Who is the customer
    * person or agency
    * must be convinced that you have a good idea that the you can perform the promised research
    * COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING
        1. email explaining: who you are, your idea, your solution, ask for there feedback.  Is this something that they are interested in, would it fit their program?  Remember these are faculty on leave from university...they understand your situation!
        2.  DON'T EVER SEND A PROPOSAL IN WITHOUT TALKING WITH THE PROGRAM MANAGER  
        3.  1-3 page white paper can be helpful, but not until you contact the program manager!!!!   
    * Program managers must justify your grant to their supervisor.  They want to look good too.
