**Summary**  
* Must attend for university researchers  
* Decoding the Agencies  
* Think in terms of a salesman.  
* How to write, what the reviewers look for, what the hate, what they love  




## 1. The Language of the Research Bid

**Defining Research**  
    * Are you proposing _research_ or _development_?  
    * Research - Systematic investigation and study of materials, etc.  
    * Development - To bring or come to an active, visible, or mature state. [NSF WILL NOT FUND THIS!!]  
    * Am I proposing an activity that will lead to new knowledge or something that makes use of existing knowledge to improve something?  

**Who is the customer?**  
    * person or agency  
    * must be convinced that you have a good idea that the you can perform the promised research  
    * `COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING`  
        1. email explaining: who you are, your idea, your solution, ask for there feedback.  Is this something that they are interested in, would it fit their program?  Remember these are faculty on leave from university...they understand your situation!  
        2.  `DON'T EVER SEND A PROPOSAL IN WITHOUT TALKING WITH THE PROGRAM MANAGER`  
        3.  1-3 page white paper can be helpful, but not until you contact the program manager!!!!   
        4. Every good research idea has multiple target grants and programs!  
        5. You are trying to get a feel for if your idea will have a high success probability
    * Program managers must justify your grant to their supervisor.  They want to look good too.  

**Grant Proposal Guide**  
    * Need to be familiar with this NSF document  
    * Primary guidebook for all NSF proposals  

**Peer Review**  
    * Your grant will be peer-reviewed.  
    * You likely know some of these people  
    * Never be negative about someones research in your proposal!  

**Pre Proposal**  
    * Very succinct, make sure this is brief  
    * 2-10 pages  
    * Don't worry about details  
    * Not a technical paper, it is designed to sell your research  
    * What do you expect to get out of your results?  
        1. Draft an outline, make multiple drafts  
        2. Tell the what are you going to do, tell them how you did (or will do) it, tell them what you did  


**Risk / Reward**  
    * Always consider the potential success rate of your proposal  
    * Does you risk/reward ratio justify submitting the proposal?  
    * What is unique about your proposed work?   

**Some Industry Terms**  
    * Ghosts: this could be equipment that you have which the other bidders do not  
    * Oh-oh : Address your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them.  Do not try to hide them  
    * Silver-bullet : A decisive strategy that can be used to eliminate the competition   
    * Theme: selling message that is woven into the proposal.  Must make it clear to the reader what it is that you are selling.  
**AVOID**  
    * Me-too: demonstrating that you are "as-good" as the competition.  You need to stand out  


**BROADER IMPACTS**  
* They love seeing unique broader impacts  
    * e.g. Demonstrating your research to the public  
* They expect (and see a lot of) graduate students related, generic outreach, etc.    

## 2. Bidding Costs and Help from your University  

* time and energy  
* Travel expenses  
* Facilities and equipment preparation   
* `STEM center`: (http://ste2m.usu.edu)[http://ste2m.usu.edu]  
  


How do you market?  
* Presenting papers and attending conferences  
    * Attend to network, you want people in your field to get to know you   
    * Get yourself known  
* In-Your-Face-Attitude with funding agencies  
    * Don't hesitate to contact somebody in your field   
    * Get on technical or scientific committees  
    * Talk about your ideas, don't worry about people stealing them!  
    * Volunteer to be a peer reviewer for agencies of interest, e.g. NSF  
        * Try to visit funding agencies every year   
* Become a public Spokesperson for your area of expertise  
    * Create a personal media package for the local and national media outlets  
    * Help the university publicist write press releases about your work  
* Publish Journal Articles  
* Be Proactive  
    *  Join professional societies, serve on committees
    *  Attend workshops and conferences in your field
    *  volunteer to review NSF proposals as an unpaid reviewer  
    *  Read abstracts of winning proposals  
    *  Follow the money  
    *  Develop a strategic plan for yourself  
        * Who are you?  
        * Where are you going?
        * How will you get there?  



## 3. The First Things to Do

* Introduce yourself to all relevant program managers (narrow the field)  
* Focus on one, tow, or three specific people  
* Try to meet with funding representatives on a regular basis   
* Arrange to have discussions with agency representatives while at conferences  

**Body Language**  
* Listen and take notes  
* If they like your idea and verbally state it, end the meeting.  Don't oversell!  

**NSF Evaluation**  
* Intellectual Merit of the proposed activity  
* Broader impacts of the proposed activity  
* These must be linked together  
* They are equally important  
* Each proposer receives an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding  


## 4. Developing the Winning Proposal

**What makes a winning proposal?**  
* Selecting a research topic  
    * Stay within your area of interest in expertise  
    * Know the field  
        * What are the frontiers of knowledge?  
        * Who are the top researchers?  
        * What are the recent advances and breakthroughs?  
        * What is the key literature?  
        * Look in paper acknowledgments for the funding agency.  
    * Know how future developments in your field will affect you research  
    * focus on a field-specific research agenda.  Try not to spread out to far, stay focused with an important but narrow objective. Don't propose to do too many things.   

* proposal is not a technical paper!  It is a selling document  
* Write as a selling pitch.  Prove that your idea is worthy of funding   
* You are writing to reviewers  
* Set the stage for those reading the proposal  
    * Need to have a great project summary   
* Your work must be novel!  

* Words of Advice  
    * Do Not obfuscate   
    * Do not confuse - make it understandable  
    * Do not be repetitions  
    * Help reviewers understand your proposal  
    * Do not make multiple submissions!  
    * Do not shotgun proposals - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY SPRAYING COLD PROPOSALS ACROSS AGENCIES  
    * Look at sample proposals  
    * Spelling is the number one complaint among reviewers  
    * Never use the word 'if'  
    * Give the impression that this work is so important that it will carry on with or without their help

What area of research do you think is most important in your (this) field?

###  Write not so that you can be understood, but so that you cannot be misunderstood  

**Writing Tips**  
* Academic researchers are not natural proposal writers  
* Use words sparingly for best impact  
* Do not start sentences with long qualifying phrases  
* Avoid excessive use of abbreviations, especially if they domain specific  
* Use phrases such as:  
    * We are already doing ...  
    * This is the next logical step in our research ...   
    * We have assembled an outstanding team of ...  
    * State with confidence that you are determined to get this research do with or without their funding.   

* Faculty researchers tend to be arrogant when writing proposals  
* Don't brag  
* Most rejected proposals are rejected early in the process b/c the reviewers cannot understand what is being proposed  
* Ask a third party to proofread  
* Every research claim must be substantiated!  If not, it must be part of your expected results or hypothesis  



## 5. Realities of the Funding Process

* How much money to you need?  
    * Anticipate this question  
    * What is the minimum amount of money to do something minimal  
    * What is maximum amount that I can handle  
    * "I can do substantial research with the range of X to Y dollars"    




* 1 out of 10 chance of being funded  
* 1 out of 100 for a cold submission  
* 90% get rejected because the are doing it wrong...so do it right!  
*


**Beyond Your Control**  

You may have written the best proposal ever and done all of the right things to win. But, you did not get the award.  

Why?  
* Political aspects  
* Personalities  
* Hidden agendas  
* Funding limitations  
* Other unmentionable  


**Lessons of Losing**  

1. Are you going to win?  
    * You cannot always win the grant, but never pursue funding unless you think you will win.  

2. Keep your customer happy  
    * Keep in touch, send new ideas and visit periodically.  

3. Get a debriefing  
    * If you do not get funded, ask for a debriefing to find out how to improve your chances next time.  

4. Always be aware of the deadly sins of losing  
 
**The key to winning is not losing!**


**This Sins of Losing**  

1. Non-responsiveness (Not answering the mail)  
    * You must read the announcement carefully and often.  

2. Poor writing  
    * There is no excuse for not proofreading your work.  

3. Unsubstantiated claims  
    * Every important research-related claim must be substantiated or be part of the expected, verifiable results.  

4. Arrogance  
    * We know you're the greatest, but you still have to compete for those research dollars.  

5 . Not listening  
    * When your customer tells you something, either listen or look for a new customer.  

6. Negativism  
    * Always be positive about your research and the work of other researchers.  

7. Indifference (Me-too-ism)  
    * If you are not excited about your research ideas and projects, who will be?
